"""
Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to find second largest distinct element in the array.

Note: If the second largest element does not exist, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 there is no second largest element.
